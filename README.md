### Hi there, I'm [Prateek Chanda](https://prateekiiest.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a Research Software Engineer at Microsoft Research India, advised by [Dr. Amit Sharma](https://www.amitsharma.in/) and [Vageesh Chandramouli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/vachand/). I have been fortunate to work on variety of interesting research problems both at MSR and beyond that has led to publications at CSCW, NeurIPs, AAAI, AISTATS, and AAAI HCOMP.
Previously, I received my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur (erstwhile BESU) and worked as a research consultant at IIT Kharagpur.


My research interests lie primarily in **large scale social networks and HCI systems** and how people behave and how through these complex network interactions, can we mine sufficient hidden information to design better interventions? I am also interested in _recommender systems_, _NLP_, _anomaly detection_ in large scale systems

Previously I was fortunate to serve as a Google Summer of Code Mentor and Google Code In Mentor where I was able to introduce open source and engage young people (school students and college sophomores) to contribute to open source.
I also served as one of the _GitHub Campus Experts_ from India to engage and inspire students to contribute to open source software.

Some of the organisations I previously worked with

- SunPy (NASA Open Source)
- FOSSASIA
- Linux Foundation
